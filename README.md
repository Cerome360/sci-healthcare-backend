Indexes Soroban contract events from the [SCI Healthcare care-voucher protocol](https://github.com/Godgift-care/sci-healthcare-contracts) into a queryable read model, and serves it over a read-only HTTP API.

The ledger is the source of truth. This service exists because a ledger cannot answer "show me every voucher this clinic is waiting on" without scanning it. Everything here is a projection: delete the database, replay from the deploy ledger, and you get the same rows back.

One click provisions the web service and its Postgres instance in the same
region, with every contract id already set. The only value you add by hand is
`CORS_ORIGIN`, once the frontend URL exists.

## Two properties worth stating up front

**It holds no keys and signs nothing.** Every state change in this protocol is a transaction signed in the user's wallet and submitted straight to Soroban RPC by the browser. This service is not in the write path. There is no custody here to steal.

**It stores no patient data.** The only patient-linked value is `beneficiaryRef`, an opaque 32-byte HMAC computed in the user's browser under a key that never leaves it. Nothing is written here that is not already public on chain, so a database breach is not a health-data breach.

## Architecture

```
  Soroban RPC ──getEvents──> Indexer ──> SQLite / Postgres ──> Fastify (read-only)
                             (cursor,                                   │
                              idempotent                                ▼
                              upserts)                              Frontend
```

The indexer polls on an interval, applies each event to the read model, and only then advances its cursor — so a crash mid-batch replays rather than skips. Handlers are idempotent upserts keyed by on-chain id, which makes replay safe.

The cursor is guarded by a lease (stored on `IndexerState`). However many indexer processes are running, exactly one holds the lease and advances the cursor; the others log that they are standing by and retry. Events are idempotent, but the cursor is not — two writers can skip events by advancing it from a stale read — which is the race the lease exists to prevent.

When the RPC fails, the indexer backs off exponentially (with jitter, up to `INDEXER_BACKOFF_MAX_MS`) instead of retrying every poll interval, and reports the failure once per streak rather than once per attempt — retrying at full speed adds load exactly where it hurts and buries every other log line. Configure more than one endpoint in `SOROBAN_RPC_URLS` and repeated failures move reads to the next one; the active endpoint is logged on each switch and reported as `checks.rpcUrl` on `/ready`.

## API

Every route is served under the canonical `/v1` prefix. The unversioned paths
(`/vouchers`, `/providers`, …) remain as aliases for clients already deployed
against them: each response on those paths carries `Deprecation: true` and a
`Link: </v1/...>; rel="successor-version"` header. New integrations should
target `/v1`.

Every response carries an `X-Request-Id`. Send one and it is echoed (after
validation); otherwise the server generates a UUID. The same value appears as
`reqId` in the log line for the request, so an id from a user is enough to find
the matching log entry.

Errors all use one envelope, whatever layer rejected the request:

```json
{ "error": "invalid_query", "message": "Invalid query parameters", "details": [] }
```

`details` is present only when there is something structured to add (for
example the Zod issues for a bad query). Error codes: `invalid_query`,
`filter_required`, `invalid_code`, `provider_not_found`, `service_not_found`,
`voucher_not_found`, `receipt_not_found`, `route_not_found`, `rate_limited`,
`bad_request`, `internal_error`. A 5xx is always `internal_error`; the cause
stays in the log, never in the response.

| Endpoint | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /health` | Liveness |
| `GET /ready` | Readiness; 503 once the indexer trails by more than `READY_MAX_LAG_LEDGERS` |
| `GET /stats` | Protocol counters for the dashboard |
| `GET /providers` | Verified clinics, filterable by `status`, `country`, `q` (case-insensitive name search) |
| `GET /providers/:address` | One clinic and its service catalogue |
| `GET /providers/:address/history` | Every status transition for a clinic, oldest first |
| `GET /providers/:address/services/:code/history` | Every observed price for a service, oldest first |
| `GET /countries` | Countries with at least one active clinic and their clinic counts |
| `GET /services` | Active services grouped by code: labels, clinic count, min/max/median price |
| `GET /services/:code` | Active clinics offering a service code with their prices, cheapest first |
| `GET /vouchers` | Vouchers by `funder`, `provider`, `beneficiaryRef` or `status`, sorted by `sort`/`order` |
| `GET /vouchers/due` | Vouchers needing action soon (expiring, refundable or settleable) within `within`, e.g. `72h` |
| `GET /vouchers.csv` | Streamed CSV export matching the same filters as `GET /vouchers` |
| `GET /vouchers/:id` | One voucher, with its care receipt if settled |
| `GET /receipts?beneficiaryRef=` / `?provider=` | A patient's settled care history, or a clinic's receipts |
| `GET /receipts/:voucherId` | One receipt, for a shareable receipt page |
| `GET /governance` | Current and pending admin per contract, plus the handover history |

`GET /vouchers` **requires at least one filter**. An unfiltered dump of every voucher is not a useful endpoint and invites scraping. It accepts `sort=createdAt|expiresAt|amount` and `order=asc|desc` (defaults: `createdAt`, `desc`). Amounts are compared with `BigInt`, so `amount` sorting is numeric rather than lexicographic.

`GET /vouchers.csv` takes the same `funder`, `provider`, `beneficiaryRef` and
`status` filters (and also requires at least one). Rows are read in batches
with a cursor and streamed as an RFC 4180 download, so the export never has to
fit in memory however many vouchers match. It deliberately has **no beneficiary
reference column**.

`/receipts` requires an exact `beneficiaryRef`. Because that value is an HMAC under a key held by the patient, the endpoint cannot be walked to enumerate people.

### Response behaviour

List routes (`/vouchers`, `/vouchers/due`, `/providers`, `/receipts`) are limited to 30 requests
per minute per client; other routes default to 120, while `/health` and `/ready`
are exempt so a struggling service can always be probed. JSON above 1 KB is
gzip-compressed when the client accepts it, and every response carries the
standard `@fastify/helmet` security headers (no CSP — this API serves JSON, not
HTML).

### Example

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8080/v1/providers?status=Active" | jq
curl "http://localhost:8080/v1/vouchers?provider=GDOOCNK2...ZKBK" | jq
curl -o vouchers.csv "http://localhost:8080/v1/vouchers.csv?funder=GDUPJTF3...G45"
```

```json
{
  "total": 1,
  "providers": [
    {
      "address": "GDOOCNK2HL6TB2Y7FDYNNMG4GTM2PNPY4XCTWG2INFPYYVA66FCPZKBK",
      "name": "Ikeja General Clinic",
      "country": "NG",
      "status": "Active",
      "services": [
        { "code": 101, "label": "Outpatient consult", "price": "30000000", "priceDisplay": "3.0000000" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Amounts are `i128` on chain and are returned as **decimal strings**. Parsing one into a JavaScript number loses precision above 2^53 — use `BigInt`.

## Environment

| Variable | Purpose | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PORT` | HTTP port | `8080` |
| `HOST` | Bind address | `0.0.0.0` |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | pino level | `info` |
| `CORS_ORIGIN` | Comma-separated allowed origins | `http://localhost:3000` |

| `DATABASE_URL` | Resolved **relative to `prisma/`** | `file:./dev.db` |
| `SOROBAN_RPC_URL` | Soroban RPC endpoint (used when `SOROBAN_RPC_URLS` is unset) | `https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org` |
| `SOROBAN_RPC_URLS` | Comma-separated endpoints, tried in order on repeated failure | `https://rpc-a.example,https://rpc-b.example` |
| `SOROBAN_RPC_MAX_FAILURES` | Consecutive failures against one endpoint before switching | `3` |
| `NETWORK_PASSPHRASE` | Network passphrase | `Test SDF Network ; September 2015` |
| `REGISTRY_CONTRACT_ID` | Registry contract | `CAMU635NRFEHATJ6MTY5SI43IAZ43KHPFXAQDQAST2AHKCHLSGWHVE4V` |
| `VOUCHER_CONTRACT_ID` | Voucher escrow | `CBPUQN6CNJCNGPKNEXB7UM4T7RINKQB7HQI5CXEOSQ5EFRHE4G4VKPSQ` |
| `RECEIPT_CONTRACT_ID` | Care receipts | `CBCJRI2BCZBMZNX77WWDC2NGSV4ZNAN5Q23XHYNBH6UTOQMPJHZGX5C7` |
| `USDC_CONTRACT_ID` | Settlement token | `CCRLJ7FEIKTR3GBT3VQQPSIJGRBO2WPNMVFKJDP6AYGJQWECOR4QVE5M` |
| `FAUCET_CONTRACT_ID` | Testnet demo faucet; optional, drips counted in `/stats` when set | `CCB25WG7DQ2CSNXPTOHZO2PDZ324FQPZLH3LSNCCLWYM3FEH52GEXC47` |
| `INDEXER_START_LEDGER` | Ledger to index from; `0` means start at the tip | `4465529` |
| `INDEXER_POLL_MS` | Poll interval | `5000` |
| `INDEXER_BACKOFF_MAX_MS` | Ceiling for the backoff applied after RPC failures | `60000` |

Set `INDEXER_START_LEDGER` to the deployment ledger. Leaving it at `0` starts at the current tip and silently skips all prior history. Soroban RPC also only retains a rolling window of ledgers (about 7 days on testnet) — an indexer that falls further behind than the window cannot catch up, and `/ready` will say so rather than pretend otherwise.

`READY_MAX_LAG_LEDGERS` (default `120`, about ten minutes at five seconds a ledger) is where `/ready` flips from 200 to 503. A free-tier demo can tolerate a much larger window than production, so tune it per deployment. `GET /ready` echoes it as `checks.maxLagLedgers`.

`SOROBAN_RPC_URLS` is the failover list. Set it to two endpoints and an outage at the first one costs a few failed reads rather than an indexing stall; with one endpoint (or only `SOROBAN_RPC_URL` set) the behaviour is exactly as before. `GET /version` reports every configured endpoint and `GET /ready` reports the active one, both with any credentials redacted.

## Running the indexer and the API separately

One process runs both by default (`npm start`). That is the right shape for a
single small deployment: fewer moving parts, and the one-click Render blueprint
assumes it.

Split them when the API and the indexer have different scaling or failure needs
— bursty API traffic alongside steady indexing, or more than one API replica.
The entry points are:

```bash
npm run start:api        # HTTP API only, no indexer
npm run start:indexer    # indexer only, no HTTP server
```

In development, `npm run dev:api` and `npm run dev:indexer` are the same split
with a watch loop. The indexer holds the cursor lease, so extra replicas are
safe: one indexes, the others log standby and retry. That also means combined
mode can be scaled to several replicas without racing — but it wastes the
standby replicas, which is the case for splitting.

`render.yaml` carries a commented two-service example. A background worker
needs a paid instance type, so the free-tier blueprint stays combined.

## Deploying

Suited to a platform that runs long-lived processes with a database attached, such as Render.

- Runtime: Node 22
- Build: `npm ci && npx prisma generate && npm run build`
- Start: `npm run db:migrate && npm start` (or `npm run start:api` / `npm run start:indexer` when split)
- Run `./scripts/use-postgres.sh` before `prisma generate` to switch the schema from `sqlite` to `postgresql`
- Provision the database in the **same region** and use its internal connection string

### Schema changes and migrations

Local development uses SQLite and `npx prisma db push`; nothing to do there. Production uses Postgres and **versioned migrations** in `prisma/migrations/`, applied on every start by `npm run db:migrate` (`prisma migrate deploy`).

To change the schema:

1. Edit `prisma/schema.prisma` (keep `provider = "sqlite"` in the committed file).
2. Against a scratch Postgres, run `./scripts/use-postgres.sh`, then `npx prisma migrate dev --name <change>`, and restore the provider to `sqlite` (`git checkout -p prisma/schema.prisma`, or edit it back).
3. Commit the new `prisma/migrations/<timestamp>_<change>/` directory with the schema change.

CI applies every migration to a fresh Postgres and then runs `prisma migrate diff`, failing the build if the schema and the migrations disagree.

**Existing database created with `db push`:** the first migration creates tables that already exist, so mark it as applied once, then deploy normally:

```bash
npx prisma migrate resolve --applied 20260101000000_init
npm run db:migrate
```

A new, empty database needs nothing special.

## Operations

- **Metrics**: `GET /metrics` is Prometheus text (not rate limited). Alert on `indexer_lag_ledgers` and `indexer_seconds_since_success`; both are set by the process running the indexer.
- **Failed events**: an event the indexer cannot project is stored in the `FailedEvent` table and `/ready` reports degraded until it is cleared. After fixing the cause, run `npm run indexer:retry-failed`; it exits non-zero while any event still fails.
- **Reconciliation**: the read model is a cache of the chain, so run `npm run indexer:reconcile` on a schedule. It reads `get_voucher` for every non-terminal voucher (plus a rolling sample of settled ones, `--sample`, default 25) and records each disagreement in `ReconcileMismatch`. `/ready` reports `checks.reconcileMismatches` and `checks.reconcile: "drift"`, but stays 200: unlike a failed event, drift says nothing about whether this instance can serve traffic. `--fix` rewrites the differing rows from chain state, which is the only safe direction. The command exits non-zero while any mismatch is open.
- **Faucet usage**: with `FAUCET_CONTRACT_ID` set, `dripped` events are indexed into `FaucetDrip` and `/stats` reports `faucetDrips` (total) and `faucetWallets` (distinct wallets) — the closest thing to a count of people who tried the demo.
